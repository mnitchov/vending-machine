# Vending Machine

Simple smart contract built on Solidity for a donut vending machine. The contract allows the owner to set a specific amount the machine starts with and allows them to restock.
Donuts in the machine are visible to the public.
The contract will only accept payments for the correct amount per donut and will advise on whether there is enough stock available to facilitate the transaction.
